# Ciphering CLI Tool

## Implement CLI tool that will encode and decode a text by 3 substitution ciphers:
* [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
* [Atbash cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash)
* [ROT-8 as variation of ROT-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

CLI tool could accept 3 options (short alias and full name):

1.  **-c, --config**: config for ciphers â€” required option
Config is a string with pattern `{XY(-)}n`, where:
  * `X` is a cipher mark:
    * `C` is for Caesar cipher (with shift 1)
    * `A` is for Atbash cipher
    * `R` is for ROT-8 cipher
  * `Y` is flag of encoding or decoding (mandatory for Caesar cipher and ROT-8 cipher and should not be passed Atbash cipher)
    * `1` is for encoding
    * `0` is for decoding
2.  **-i, --input**: a path to input file
3.  **-o, --output**: a path to output file

For example, config `"C1-C1-R0-A"` means "encode by Caesar cipher => encode by Caesar cipher => decode by ROT-8 => use Atbash"

## Details:

1. If the input file option is missed - `stdin` will be used as an input source.
2. If the output file option is missed - `stdout` will be used as an output destination.
3. Encoding and decoding works only with en alphabet. All other characters will be kept untouched.
